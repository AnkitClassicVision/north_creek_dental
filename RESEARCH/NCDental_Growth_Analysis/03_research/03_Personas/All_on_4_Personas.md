## Implications for NCDental

### SO WHAT? (Significance)

### NOW WHAT? (Action Items)
1. Create persona-specific landing pages
2. Develop ad creative for each persona's primary concerns
3. Train front desk to identify persona type on first call
4. Customize consultation experience by persona

### COMPARED TO? (Benchmarks)
- Top practices segment by persona
- ClearChoice uses one-size-fits-all approach
- Opportunity to differentiate through personalization
