# Red Team Analysis: Assumptions & Risks

## Executive Summary

This analysis challenges the key assumptions underlying NCDental's growth strategy and identifies risks that could undermine success. The goal is to ensure the strategy is robust against alternative scenarios.

---

## Key Assumptions Challenged

### Assumption 1: "Credentials and expertise matter more than price"

**The Assumption:**
Patients seeking All-on-4 implants will prioritize doctor expertise and credentials over price, making NCDental's specialist team a decisive advantage.

**Evidence Supporting:**
- Research shows trust is primary decision factor for high-ticket procedures
- Patient reviews frequently mention doctor skill and experience
- NCDental has genuinely exceptional credentials (board-certified, 40+ years)

**Counter-Evidence:**
- ClearChoice's volume model suggests many patients DO choose based on marketing reach and perceived convenience
- $10-20k price differences can override credential concerns for many families
- "Board-certified" may not resonate with patients who don't understand the distinction
- DSOs are improving their credential positioning

**Probability Assessment:**
- Original prior: 0.70 (Trust > Price)
- Updated: **0.65**
- Status: **Partially confirmed, but price matters more than assumed**

**Risk Mitigation:**
- Emphasize value per year of life, not just credentials
- Offer competitive financing to reduce price barrier
- Educate patients on what credentials actually mean for outcomes

### Assumption 2: "ClearChoice's organizational issues create a lasting opportunity"

**The Assumption:**
ClearChoice's BBB complaints and organizational problems will drive patients to seek alternatives, creating sustained opportunity for NCDental.

**Evidence Supporting:**
- B- BBB rating is documented
- Multiple patient complaints about scheduling, billing, follow-up
- Private practice model inherently more personal

**Counter-Evidence:**
- ClearChoice has strong brand awareness that overshadows complaints
- Most patients don't check BBB before choosing
- ClearChoice could improve operations, closing the gap
- Negative reviews are a small percentage of total patients
- Some patients prefer the "big brand" perceived safety

**Probability Assessment:**
- Original prior: 0.75 (Differentiation opportunity exists)
- Updated: **0.70**
- Status: **Confirmed but window may be temporary**

**Risk Mitigation:**
- Don't rely solely on competitor weakness
- Build affirmative brand strength, not just "not ClearChoice"
- Monitor ClearChoice for operational improvements

### Assumption 3: "Google Ads will deliver predictable, scalable ROI"

**The Assumption:**
Dental implant Google Ads will consistently deliver 10-30x ROI based on industry benchmarks.

**Evidence Supporting:**
- Case studies show 4-8x+ ROI for optimized campaigns
- High-intent keywords correlate with serious buyers
- Proven channel for dental implant marketing

**Counter-Evidence:**
- Cost per click rising 10-20% annually in competitive markets
- Ad fraud and click waste can eat budgets
- Algorithm changes can tank performance overnight
- Local competition could bid up costs
- Attribution is often imperfect (phone calls, multiple touchpoints)

**Probability Assessment:**
- Original prior: 0.70 (Google Ads highest ROI)
- Updated: **0.65**
- Status: **Confirmed but with higher uncertainty**

**Risk Mitigation:**
- Diversify across multiple channels (SEO, social, referrals)
- Build owned audience (email list, retargeting pools)
- Implement rigorous attribution tracking
- Have contingency budget for cost increases

---

### Assumption 4: "The local market can support significant growth"

**The Assumption:**
The Chicago Southland market has sufficient demand to support NCDental's growth targets (15-30+ implant cases/month).

**Evidence Supporting:**
- Demographics favorable (aging, affluent)
- Large population in service area (~250k primary, 1.5M+ secondary)
- National implant market growing 6-9% annually

**Counter-Evidence:**
- Competitor presence may already capture available demand
- Economic downturn could defer elective procedures
- Actual conversion rates may be lower than benchmarks
- Market may be more saturated than data suggests

**Probability Assessment:**
- Market growth: **Confirmed (0.80+)**
- Ability to capture share: **Uncertain (0.60)**

**Risk Mitigation:**
- Start with conservative projections
- Track market share metrics vs. absolute numbers
- Be prepared to expand geographic targeting
- Develop service line diversification

---

### Assumption 5: "Financing significantly increases conversion"

**The Assumption:**
Prominent financing options will increase consultation-to-treatment conversion by 25-40%.

**Evidence Supporting:**
- Industry research supports financing lift
- High-ticket procedure = cash flow concern for many
- CareCredit and similar have proven track record

**Counter-Evidence:**
- Target demographic (affluent Southland) may not need financing
- Financing friction (credit checks, applications) can delay decisions
- Some patients view financing as "being poor"
- Interest costs may deter conservative buyers

**Probability Assessment:**
- Original prior: 0.75
- Updated: **0.70**
- Status: **Confirmed with demographic nuance**

**Risk Mitigation:**
- Offer financing but don't lead with it for affluent patients
- Train staff to read patient signals on financial approach
- Provide cash-pay options and clear pricing
- Use financing as conversion tool for "on the fence" patients

## Implications for NCDental

### SO WHAT? (Significance)
