7. Imagery & Iconography

A. Icon Strategy (No Emojis)

The use of standard emojis (💰, 📈) is strictly forbidden. They clash with the premium aesthetic.

Use: High-quality, thin-stroke SVG icons (e.g., Lucide or Phosphor Icons).

Style: stroke-width: 1.5px.

Color: Inherit text color or use the Primary Accent (#6366F1) for emphasis.

Container: Place key icons inside a "Glass Squircle" (rounded square) with a soft colored background (e.g., bg-indigo-50).

B. Photographic Style: "Abstract Macro"

Since the analysis is precise and medical (Eye Care), imagery should reflect clarity and fluidity.

Subject Matter: Macro photography of water droplets, refracted light, glass textures, or abstract iris patterns.

Vibe: Refreshing, hydration, clarity, clean.

Treatment: Images should have soft, non-black shadows. Apply a subtle overlay of the background color (#F8FAFC at 10% opacity) to blend them into the page.

C. Persona Styling (Approved)

Human portraits for Personas are the only exception to the "Abstract" rule.

Shape: Circular or "Squircle" crops.

Border: Add a 3px solid white border (#FFFFFF) and a soft shadow to pop them off the glass card.

Effect: Black & White photos with the background removed often look more "editorial," but high-quality color headshots are acceptable if lighting is soft.

D. Data Visualization

Charts must look like they are made of light.

Lines: Use gradients (e.g., Emerald fading to transparent), not solid colors.

Grid Lines: Dotted and extremely subtle (rgba(0,0,0,0.05)).

Tooltips: Glassmorphism style (blurred background) instead of solid black boxes.

E. Performance-First Animation Guidelines (CRITICAL)

The premium aesthetic must NOT sacrifice loading speed. All visual effects must be GPU-optimized.

1. Aurora Background Performance

REQUIRED: Use transform3d for GPU acceleration, NEVER animate top/left/width/height.

- will-change: transform on aurora blobs (promotes to GPU layer)
- transform: translate3d(0, 0, 0) as base (forces GPU compositing)
- filter: blur(80px) with opacity: 0.6 (soft edges, reduced paint cost)
- animation-duration: 20s minimum (slow = smooth = low CPU)
- Use scale() within transform for size changes, never width/height

2. Glass Card Performance

- Apply will-change: transform ONLY on :hover state
- Remove will-change on :not(:hover) to free GPU memory
- ONLY animate transform and opacity properties
- NEVER animate: box-shadow, width, height, padding, margin, border
- Use isolation: isolate to prevent backdrop-filter repaint propagation
- Maximum 5 elements with backdrop-filter per page

3. Hover Lift Effect

GOOD (GPU accelerated):
  transform: translateY(-4px) scale(1.02);
  opacity: 0.95;

BAD (triggers layout/paint):
  top: -4px;
  box-shadow: 0 20px 40px rgba(0,0,0,0.3);
  margin-top: -4px;

4. Reduced Motion Support (REQUIRED for accessibility)

All pages MUST include @media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) rules:
- Disable all CSS animations
- Remove transform hover effects
- Provide static aurora fallback (fixed gradient)
- Ensure content is still visually appealing without motion

5. Scroll Reveal Performance

- Use IntersectionObserver API (not scroll event listeners)
- Apply will-change: transform, opacity ONLY when element enters viewport
- Remove will-change after animation completes
- Use CSS transitions, not JavaScript-driven animations
- rootMargin: "50px" for pre-loading before visible

6. Resource Loading Priority

Critical (load immediately):
- Aurora CSS (inline in <head>)
- Typography CSS
- Hero section styles

Deferred (load after paint):
- Scroll reveal JavaScript
- Spotlight cursor effect
- Chart/data visualization scripts

Lazy (load on interaction):
- Spotlight effect (on first mousemove)
- Complex animations
- Analytics scripts
